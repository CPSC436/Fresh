Fresh is a web application that helps consumers make cost-friendly choices for groceries. Users can post grocery prices, locations and images to the app, and see reported deals submitted by other people. Leave thumbs up or down to help validate posts. Compare the prices of groceries through the search and sort features. When you find a deal that you like, bookmark them for later and see them in the shopping list.

## Technologies 

**HTML/CSS/Javascript**
- Used HTML for img sources
- Making items align using the <span>
- CSS for general styling like grid, placements, margins and paddings.
  
**React/Redux/Meteor and the Front End**
- React to make UI components such as ShoppingList, Card, MapContainer. 
- Redux to maintain the store, managing states on the frontend.  

**Meteor and the Back End**
- Meteor methods for interacting with the database.
- Managing user accounts, verification. Information hiding for unverified users.
- Managing dropdown items, shopping list, list items in the database. 

**NoSQL and MongoDB**
- MongoDB Atlas for cloud database. 
- Data-structure for each field. 
- Setting up and deploying on heroku was straightforward using commonly used Meteor buildpack. Additional environment variables configured and automated Master branch deployments enabled. 

**Release Engineering**
- Used heroku for deployment.

## Challenges, Learning, and Future Directions

**Challenge and Learning**
- For the rating thumbs up/down, the rating was being updated in the database, but it wasnâ€™t displayed on the frontend. 
- Passing down data from component to store, and store back to component, trigger re-renders and displaying right contents. 
- Used a debugger, step through, checked params to diagnose the problem.
- Solution was to use mapStatetoProps, which is used for selecting the part of the data from the store that the connected component needs. Re-renders upon store change. 

**Future Direction**
- Add the ability to watch for deals. We want the app to notify users when a new deal or cheaper deal is added. 
- Mobile Integration.
- Use mobile or device location to post.
- Use image recognition to do some of the post reporting.

# Development

## Local
Run `meteor run` in root directory to begin serving on `localhost:3000`

Run `meteor reset` to start with a fresh local MongoDB instance

## Local, with Atlas hosted MongoDB
Run `sh start.sh` in root directory to begin serving on `localhost:3000` while targetting the Atlas hosted MongoDB and enabling Emailing of password reset and shopping lists.
